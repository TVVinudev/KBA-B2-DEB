                    "Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of
                    life:
                    They feed the soul. When writers make us shake our heads with the exactness of their prose and their
                    truths,
                    and even make us laugh about ourselves or life, our buoyancy is restored. We are given a shot at
                    dancing with,
                    or at least clapping along with, the absurdity of life, instead of being squashed by it over and
                    over again.
                    It's like singing on a boat during a terrible storm at sea. You can't stop the raging storm,
                    but singing can change the hearts and spirits of the people who are together on that ship."
